Hi üëãüèΩ! I'm Juan, data scientist and AI specialist, who loves science, teaching, programming, and the open knowledge and software.

I started my path into AI when I was finishing my engineering degree, and become fascinated about the idea that we can add mechanisms for the computer programs to learn over time.

I then started to partifipate into research projects in an area that I fell in love with: reinforcement learning, which I did my PhD on, focused on the automatic tuning of reinforcement learning agents, where I started my own research and started formulating my own hypotheses, which I got right in some cases and wrong in others.

After that, I switched from academia to [MercadoLibre](https://mercadolibre.com), where I love to apply what I've learned to solve real-world problems with a user-centric perspective.
